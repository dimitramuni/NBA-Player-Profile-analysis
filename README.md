# In Search of Jail Blazers’ Years The Team, The Resultsand The String of Controversialities and Obscenities
## Abstract:
Portland  Trail  Blazers  undergone  an  impressive  transformation  at  the  end  ofthe 90s.  The club recruited a number of young, talented basketball players, wholoved their games and wanted to enjoy the flare and excitement.  which the celebritystatus entailed.  The record was impressive; the lads won in average 55 games outof 82 in the regular season.  In season 1998-1999, Portland was the champion of the Pacific division.  One of the most expensive teams, Los Angeles Lakers could onlyclaim the second position in the same division.  However, their off-court behaviourattracted more media attention, than their on-court success.  In order to amelioratethe team’s reputation and to stop the decline of the number of paying spectatorsof the home games, the club made a number of bold decisions between season 2003- 2004, and season 2005 - 2006.  At the end, the Portland could only win 21 games in the regular season.  In this project, the players’ skill and the strength of the coresquads were analysed with a number of computational data mining and statisticalmethodologies.   The  intention  was  to  learn  which  mistakes  the  club  made,  whenattempting  to  replace  the  trouble  maker  bad  boys  with  a  group  of  new  players.The obtained results from the cluster analysis proved that the top offensive playerscould perform well, if and only if the defensive players possessed the skills, whichthe offensive players lacked, were willing to the share the ball for the benefit of theteam.  Furthermore, as a team, the players could play well together, if there was areal sense of camaraderie both on and off the court.
